This simple weather dashboard allows the user to search for weather conditions by City, returning the current conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index for their selected location in addition to the five-day forecast. The weather information is pulled from OpenWeather's API.

When a user searches for a new city, that city is added to a list of previously searched cities beneath the search bar. Duplicate searches will not result in a city's name being added twice. Each previously-searched city name is a clickable link allowing the user to search for a city's weather again.
